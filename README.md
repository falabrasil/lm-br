# Language Model Training :brazil:

:fox_face: Pre-trained models on GitLab (LFS):
https://gitlab.com/fb-resources/lm-br

Scripts to train n-gram language models in ARPA format, currently using only
[SRILM](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/). Based on Kaldi scripts
for LibriSpeech ([local/lm/train_lm.sh](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/blob/master/egs/librispeech/s5/local/lm/train_lm.sh)).

It also generates a phonetic dicionary from a pre-specified list of words 
(top-N most frequent, estimated from OSCAR) using 
[FalaBrasil's G2P](https://hub.docker.com/r/falabrasil/g2p).

A demonstration is performed over five files of the first version (2019) of the
[OSCAR corpus](https://oscar-corpus.com/post/oscar-2019/#downloading-oscar).
Raw data sums up to 9.5 GB while after normalisation clean data is 7.5 GB.


## Usage

:warning: Remember SRILM must be installed and set to `$PATH` beforehand.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/falabrasil/lm-br.git
$ cd lm-br
$ ./run.sh
```


## Docker :whale:

:warning: We won't be pushing this image to dockerhub because SRILM's license 
might now allow it. Make sure to download SRILM yourself and place the
`*.tar.gz` file under this repo's dir.

To build the Debian-slim-based image and check for SRILM's version, do the 
following:

```bash
$ cd lm-br  # from git clone
$ docker build -t falabrasil/lm-br:latest -f docker/Dockefile .
$ docker run --rm -it falabrasil/lm-br:latest bash
$ ngram -version
```

The output should be as follows:

```text
SRILM release 1.7.3 (with third-party contributions)
Built with GCC 11.1.0
and options -g -O3 

Program version @(#)$Id: ngram-count.cc,v 1.81 2019/09/09 23:13:13 stolcke Exp $

## Notes :memo:

- Beware you'll probably need at least 32 GB of RAM on your machine. Sparing
  some swap space is also advised.
- You'll also need docker :whale: installed and running for G2P.
- Evaluation is performed on the Portuguese portion of
  [Mozilla's Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) dataset.
- On Debian-based OS, `pkg-config`, `libaspell-dev`, and `libicu-dev` are
  dependencies to some Python modules. Check the Dockerfile to see the packages
  downloaded via `apt-get`.
